# DosUAE 

With DosUAE you can emulate an Amiga 500 under DOS but also 68020 CPU + FPU, up to 2MB Chip RAM, 8 MB fast RAM and another 1 MB of RAM. You get something like an Amiga 2500 if you all max out. 

The minimal host-system should be a Pentium or Dx PC with an SVGA board and 20 MB disk free space.
